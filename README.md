# Dog Breed Classifier

This repository contains the code and resources for building a dog breed classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The classifier can detect dogs, humans, and find resemblances between humans and specific dog breeds.

## Contents

- `dog_app.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step process of building the dog breed classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. All you need to do is run each cell code in order.
- `README.md`: Readme file providing an overview of the repository and its contents.
- `Blog.md`: Markdown file containing a blog entry about the dog breed classifier.
- `extract_bottleneck_features.py`: python script is for transfering learning, i.e pre-trained models, typically trained on large datasets, are utilized as a starting point for solving new tasks or working with smaller datasets. The syntax is included in `dog_app.ipynb`.
- `extract_bottleneck_features.py`
