# Dog Breed Classifier

This repository contains the code and resources for building a dog breed classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The classifier can detect dogs, humans, and find resemblances between humans and specific dog breeds.

## Contents

- `dog_app.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step process of building the dog breed classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Readme file providing an overview of the repository and its contents.
- `Blog.md`: Markdown file containing a blog entry about the dog breed classifier.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook and use the dog breed classifier, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Keras with TensorFlow backend
- OpenCV
